# A simple hashmap implementation

### Collision handling.
Open addressing with double hashing. Double hashing makes use of two hash functions
to calculate the index an item should be stored at after i collisions. What happens when the array is full?



### Naming convention
```
ht_<module_name>_<function_name>
```

for a function that works on a struct:
```
ht_<module_name>_<StructName>_<function_name>
```
